[INSTALLATION]
    Run install.sh to install the software and the needed libraries.
    The installation procedure takes ca. 15 minutes.


[RUNNING MIRZA]
    Instructions on how to pass parameters to the program will be
    displayed once the installation is completed.


[miRNA FILE FORMATS]

    miRNA epression files should be in this format:
    name[tab|space|multiple spaces]expression level

    examples:
    hsa-miR-19b	    1749716.66654086
    hsa-miR-7	1363730.98809087


    miRNA sequence files should be in this format:
    >name
    sequence
    example:
    >hsa-miR-19b
    UGUGCAAAUCCAUGCAAAACU

    miRNA sequences must have a length of al least 21 nucleotides. If longer,
    the sequence will be trimmed. If shorter, it will be discarded.


[mRNA FILE FORMAT]
    mRNA files should be in FASTA format.
    example:
    >NM_002467|1998|2048|13977.5472816059|21.6094593545982|2023
    TTGAGACTGAAAGATTTAGCCATAATGTAAACTGCCTCAAATTGGACTTTG

    mRNA sequences must have the same length. If not, the program will exit.
